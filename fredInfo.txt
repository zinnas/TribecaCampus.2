Fred Peskoff, BMCC Mathematics Professor and Chair of the Mathematics Department, created The Leila and Simon Peskoff Family Endowment in honor of his parents in 2001. This endowment awards tuition scholarships, graduation awards and research stipends to students who are often the first in their families to attend college, and might otherwise not have continued with their studies. Dr. Peskoff also made possible, through a generous gift to BMCC in 2015, the naming of The Leila and Simon Peskoff Nursing Skills Laboratory on BMCC’s main campus.

Dr. Peskoff is a Foundation Board member of the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), and was a 2003 winner of the AMATYC Teaching Excellence Award, a national honor. In 2016, his donation established The Peskoff Award to be presented annually to an AMATYC Project ACCCESS fellow who has contributed to the profession of mathematics instruction and taught students in their first two years of college.

In addition to his master’s and doctoral degrees in mathematics education, Dr. Peskoff holds a master’s degree in psychology, which helps inform his insights into student math anxiety. In a 2007 article by Elizabeth Farrell,”Taking Anxiety Out of the Equation” in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Dr. Peskoff is quoted as saying, “as professors, we have to be aware of the issues that impact student learning. We can’t just know the content of math. We need to know more about how students learn.”
